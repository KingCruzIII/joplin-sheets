# JSheets

Implementation of [Luckysheet](https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet) for Joplin. You can now write excel-like notes!  

## How to?

Initiate a JSheet by writing following in the markdown:

```md
```JSheets```
```

You can now re-open the note and the plugin will load.

## Example

## Notes

- The [Luckysheet](https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet) library is bundled into the plugin.
- It was only tested in the MacOS Desktop App (but should in theory work across all apps)
