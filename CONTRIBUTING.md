# Developers Guide

## Collaborate

Since I’ve not so much free time, contributions are very welcome.  
Please follow this [tutorial on collaborating via github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=81uKcXZoQ2A).  
Thanks in advance!


## Setup

The project is kept as simple as possible, so it is very easy to set up.  
Actually, you don’t need to do anything. You will find all work files under `src/`.  
You can run `yarn dist` to build the package and then open joplin in dev mode as usual. See `package.json` for more info.

## Testing

- I did not write any tests yet. This would be a welcoming addition!
- So you'll have to test everything manually!

# Thanks for your willingness to contribute, you're awesome
